# Godot Game Template
A simple game template for making Godot games

## What is this?

This is a simple template for a game with menus enabled to allow the following:

1. Exiting the Game
2. Showing Credits
3. Modifying Settings
4. Pausing the Game

## Who is this for?

Three main types of people:

1. Anyone learning Godot
2. Anyone taking part in a Gam Jam and wanting to focus on the game and not menus
3. Anyone lazy who doesn't want to write code (me me me!)

## What settings are there?

Basic settings that most games need:

### Sound

1. Music Volume
2. Effects Volume
3. Dialog Volume

NB: The template includes audio buses for these 3 common audio types, you can easily add or remove buses as needed

### Graphics

1. Fullscreen Toggle
2. MSAA setting

These are just to get you started, you can add more

### Controls

1. Remap keybindings for up, down, left and right

NB: This is based off a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/I_Kzb-d-SvM) by Gonkee. It is extensible and you can easily add you own key mappings
